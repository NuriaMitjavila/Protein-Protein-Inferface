# Biophysics, energy analysis of a protein-protein interface
The aim of this practical is to evaluate the relative contribution of interface residues to the interaction energy in the protein-protein complex between the Receptor Binding Domain of SARS-Cov-2 Spike Protein and its receptor Angiotensin Converting Enzyme. The formation of this complex is an important step in the viral infection of the COVID19 in humans. Most of the vaccines try to block this binding, so that we do not get infect. This analysis is going to be done with the structure 6M0J that we get from the PDB. This crystal structure contains only the RBD domain from Spike binding the ACE2.

In this GitHub repository, you can find all the scripts that we use during the practical. If you want to execute all the files and get the same results that we get, download the folder EXECUTION and run the file execution.py after changing the directories.
